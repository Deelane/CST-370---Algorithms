hw1 - Reads the number of input values from a user and then the input values themselves. After that, the numbers are displayed in ascending order. Consecutive numbers are displayed using a shorter representation. For example, if there are three numbers such as 51, 52, and 53 in the input values, they are displayed as 51â€“53 to save space.
hw2 - Reads an input graph data from a user. Then, presents a path for the travelling salesman problem (TSP). 
hw3 - Implements the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm using a stack and a mark array.
